# SQL Parser

This project is an open-source SQL parser that provides functionality to parse SQL queries into a structured format. It supports various SQL features and constructs, allowing users to analyze and manipulate SQL statements programmatically.

## Key Features

- **Parsing SQL Queries**: The parser can handle a wide range of SQL queries, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and more.
- **Support for Common SQL Constructs**: It recognizes and processes common SQL constructs such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and subqueries.
- **Extensible Architecture**: The parser is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add custom handlers for new SQL features or modify existing behavior.
- **Error Handling**: The parser includes mechanisms for error detection and reporting, making it easier to debug SQL queries.
- **Integration with SQLAlchemy**: The parser can be integrated with SQLAlchemy for enhanced database interaction and ORM capabilities.
